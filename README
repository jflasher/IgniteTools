IgniteTools Platform
=============

This repo holds the code used to make the app seen at the [Ars Sollertia](http://www.arssollertia.com/?p=749) site. It was used to produce the Ignite Boulder app. The initial idea was to use this as a platform to quickly turn out apps for Ignite events, but it never took off. 

The app has a data update mechanism so new versions don't need to be pushed to add new data. The app provides a way to see info on the videos, speakers and events that are associated with the Ignite events. There is also a push mechanism in place to let users know of new data updates.

Use it as you like, if you have any questions, feel free to let me know.
